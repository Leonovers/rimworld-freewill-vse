[i]PLEASE NOTE: This mod requires the Ideology DLC.[/i]

[h1]Free Will[/h1]
[b]Imbue your colonists with free will and let their ideology determine how they
use this new power![/b]

This mod adds a powerful work tab AI placed within a new [i]Ideology[/i] precept
called [i]Free will[/i]. The ability to control colonists (via the work tab) is
now entirely dependent on their ideology.

Free Will is the result of: 1000 hours of gameplay, 100s of hours of development,
and countless hours of testing by the amazing subscribers of my beta version,

[h2]Why would I want this?[/h2]
Setting up the work tab becomes a burden after hundreds of hours of gameplay.
Starting a colony with mandatory free will allows you to create colonies much
quicker and focus on story goals, rather than wasting time setting up work
tasks.

Specifically:
[list]
    [*] Players new to the game might find it nice to automate the priorities and focus on learning other game mechanics.
    [*] Experienced players might be tired of setting up work tabs over and over.
    [*] Hardcore players might enjoy the challenge of having to manage even more unruly colonists.
    [*] Streamers might enjoy having a mod that skips the boring stuff and brings even more story into RimWorld.
[/list]

The mod follows in the tradition of RimWorld being a story generator. It will
not make the game easier to play, but it should help enrich the story that gets
created.

[h2]How do I set it up?[/h2]
Each ideology will now include the [i]Free will[/i] precept. There are a few
options:

[list]
    [*] [b]Mandatory[/b] - free will is always on and cannot be toggled
    [*] [b]Preferred[/b] - free will can be disabled, but there is a mood penalty
    [*] [b]Flexible[/b] - free will can be toggled without penalty
    [*] [b]Disapproved[/b] - free will can be enabled, but there is a mood penalty
    [*] [b]Prohibited[/b] - free will cannot be enabled ([i]this is essentially the Vanilla RimWorld experience[/i])
[/list]

Depending on the choice, colonists may not appear on the work tab, and will
instead rely on the AI (their "free will") to set their work priorities.

If allowed, you can toggle free will in the colonist's [i]Free Will[/i] tab, but
setting it to something they don't like may incure a mood penalty.

[h2]How do colonists with free will choose what to do?[/h2]
Colonists with free will enabled will prioritize work on their own. You can see
the calculations for each work type in the [i]Free Will[/i] tab. Priorities will
change in response to a number of game events.

Here is a rough guide to understanding the AI:
[list]
    [*] Colonists want to do things they are good at doing.
    [*] Colonists don't want to do things they are bad at doing.
    [*] Colonists want to pursue their passions if they are in a good mood.
    [*] Colonists want to clean more if they find the environment messy.
    [*] Colonists want to rest if their health is low.
    [*] Colonists who are bored will look for anything they are capable of doing.
[/list]
[i]The colony will assign someone to every work type (unless no one can do it).[/i]

[h2]What about slaves?[/h2]
Slaves never have free will.

[h2]Compatibility with other mods[/h2]
You should be able to use this with other mods, even if those mods add or change
work types. However, the AI is balanced for the vanilla work types. It will use
"fallback" logic for any work type it doesn't recognise. You can also apply a
global adjustment to any work type in the mod settings.

[h1]Tips for playing with Free Will[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Don't queue up too much work at one time.
    [*] A dirty base usually means the colonists have too much to do.
    [*] Idle colonists usually means there is not enough work to do.
    [*] Make decisions based on what your colonists want to do - trust me!
[/list]

[h1]Known issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*] When used with [b]Simple Sidearms[/b] it may disable hunting regardless
        of having a hunting weapon as a sidearm.
